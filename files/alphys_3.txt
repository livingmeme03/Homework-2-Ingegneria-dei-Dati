* Well, actually, umm,
  there's just a
  tiny issue.
* A long time ago, I
  made a robot named
  Mettaton.
* Originally, I built
  him to be an
  entertainment robot.
* Uh, you know, like
  a robotic TV star
  or something.
* Anyway, recently I
  decided to make him
  more useful.
* You know, just some
  small practical
  adjustments.
* Like, um...
* Anti... anti-human
  combat features?
* Of c-course, when I
  saw you coming, I
  immediately decided...
* I have to remove
  those features!
* Unfortunately, I may
  have made a teensy
  mistake while doing so.
* And, um...
* Now he's an unstoppable
  killing machine with a
  thirst for human blood?
* Ehehehehe...
* Heh.
* But, ummm, hopefully
  we won't run into
  him!
